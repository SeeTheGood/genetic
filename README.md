Genetic Algorithm for Evolving Phrases

This project demonstrates a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of phrases towards a target phrase. The algorithm simulates natural selection by iteratively selecting, crossing over, and mutating individuals in a population until the target phrase is found.

Overview

The genetic algorithm initializes a population of random phrases and evolves them over generations by:

Calculating the fitness of each phrase based on its similarity to the target phrase.
Creating a mating pool where phrases are added multiple times based on their fitness.
Selecting parents from the mating pool to create offspring through crossover and mutation.
Replacing the population with these new offspring.
The process repeats until a phrase matches the target phrase.

Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher
The phrase module containing the Phrase class and target variable
The helpers module containing the summarize function
Setup

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic-algorithm-phrases.git
cd genetic-algorithm-phrases
Ensure you have the required modules in your project directory:

phrase.py with Phrase class and target variable
helpers.py with summarize function
Install any necessary dependencies (if any).

Usage

Open the genetic.py file and ensure the target phrase is correctly defined in phrase.py.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python genetic.py
The script will output the generation number, the best phrase in the current generation, and its fitness score until the target phrase is found.

Details

Phrase Class
The Phrase class should include:

Initialization with random characters.
A getFitness method that calculates the fitness score based on the number of matching characters with the target phrase.
A getContents method that returns the current phrase.
A crossover method that combines two parent phrases to create a child phrase.
A mutate method that introduces random mutations to the phrase.
target Variable
The target variable should be defined in phrase.py and contain the target phrase as a string.

summarize Function
The summarize function in helpers.py should output the current generation, best phrase, and fitness score.
